# Interrogas
Interrogas is an online platform that guides its users through Mexican election data generated by Registered Pollsters. 

Interrogas also provides forecast projections for upcoming elections based on this information. To this end, Interrogas incorporates data visualization and geo-referenced mapping tools.

Additionally, Interrogas incorporates several administrative features that make managing the data easy.
Further, Interrogas offers a variety of survey and mapping option features to help clarify the vast amount of information collected during the election cycles.‚Äù

Interrogas is an MVP and due to the propietary nature of the code I can only provide snippets of my code.  This respository contains the essence of my SQL, .NET and React code for the Pollsters Feature.
